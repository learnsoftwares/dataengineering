Central System for Data Storage and Querying:

Definition:
A database serves as a central system for storing and querying data. In professional data contexts, it refers to a dedicated system for managing data records, distinct from a simple file system.


Relational Databases:

Characteristics:
Structured Data: Commonly used for storing and querying structured data.
Table Structure: Data is organized into tables representing entities like customers, products, or sales orders.
Primary Keys: Each entity instance has a unique primary key for identification.
Normalization: Ensures elimination of duplicate data values by using keys for referencing entities across tables.

SQL: Managed and queried using Structured Query Language (SQL), standardized across database systems.

Non-Relational Databases (NoSQL):

Characteristics:
No Fixed Schema: Non-relational databases don't strictly adhere to a relational schema.

Types:
Key-Value Databases: Each record consists of a unique key and an associated value.
Document Databases: Values are JSON documents optimized for parsing and querying.
Column Family Databases: Store tabular data with columns grouped into families.
Graph Databases: Store entities as nodes with links defining relationships.

NoSQL Term: Although some support SQL variants, they are commonly referred to as NoSQL databases.

Common Non-Relational Database Types:

Key-Value Databases:
Each record has a unique key and an associated value in any format.

Document Databases:
A form of key-value database where values are JSON documents.

Column Family Databases:
Store tabular data with columns divided into logical groups (column families).

Graph Databases:
Entities represented as nodes with links defining relationships.

In summary, databases play a crucial role in data management, and the choice between relational and non-relational databases depends on the nature of the data and the specific requirements of the application.
Relational databases are well-suited for structured data, while NoSQL databases offer flexibility for various data structures and types.
