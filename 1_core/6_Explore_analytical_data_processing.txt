### Explore Analytical Data Processing

#### Overview:

- **Nature of Analytical Data Processing:**
  - Analytical data processing involves read-only (or read-mostly) systems that store extensive volumes of historical data or business metrics.
  - Analytics can be based on snapshots of data at specific points in time or a series of snapshots.

#### Common Architecture for Enterprise-Scale Analytics:

1. **Operational Data ETL (Extract, Transform, Load):**
   - Operational data is extracted, transformed, and loaded into a data lake for analysis.

2. **Table Schema in Data Warehouse or Data Lakehouse:**
   - Data is loaded into a schema of tables, often in a Spark-based data lakehouse or a data warehouse with a fully relational SQL engine.

3. **OLAP Model (Online Analytical Processing):**
   - Aggregated data may be loaded into an OLAP model or cube.
   - Aggregated numeric values (measures) are calculated for intersections of dimensions from dimension tables (e.g., sales revenue by date, customer, and product).

4. **Querying for Reports and Visualizations:**
   - Data in the data lake, data warehouse, and analytical model can be queried to produce reports, visualizations, and dashboards.

#### Components of Analytical Database Architecture:

*Refer to the Diagram Showing Analytical Database Architecture:*
- **1. Operational Data ETL:** Data extraction, transformation, and loading into a data lake.
- **2. Table Schema:** Tables in a Spark-based data lakehouse or a data warehouse.
- **3. OLAP Model (Cube):** Aggregated data storage optimized for analytical workloads.
- **4. Reports and Visualizations:** Querying data for generating reports, visualizations, and dashboards.

#### Data Storage Technologies:

1. **Data Lakes:**
   - Common in large-scale analytical processing scenarios.
   - Suitable for collecting and analyzing a large volume of file-based data.

2. **Data Warehouses:**
   - Established method for storing data in a relational schema optimized for read operations.
   - Primarily designed to support reporting and data visualization.

3. **Data Lakehouses:**
   - Innovative approach combining flexible and scalable storage of a data lake with relational querying semantics of a data warehouse.
   - May involve some denormalization for faster query performance.

#### OLAP Models:

- **Definition:**
  - An aggregated type of data storage optimized for analytical workloads.
  - Enables drilling up/down to view aggregations at multiple hierarchical levels (e.g., total sales by region, city, or individual address).
  - Pre-aggregated data allows for quick queries to return summaries.

#### User Roles in Analytical Architecture:

1. **Data Scientists:**
   - Work directly with data files in a data lake to explore and model data.

2. **Data Analysts:**
   - Query tables directly in the data warehouse to produce complex reports and visualizations.

3. **Business Users:**
   - Consume pre-aggregated data in an analytical model through reports or dashboards.

In conclusion, analytical data processing involves leveraging historical data for in-depth analysis. The architecture includes components like data lakes, data warehouses, and OLAP models, catering to various user roles with distinct requirements in the analytical workflow.
